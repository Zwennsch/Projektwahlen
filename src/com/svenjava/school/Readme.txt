todo:
	- learn junit testing; testing edge cases
	- gray out courses after they have been chosen already.
	- save students after every entry.
	- change reading and writing to file in DataHandler and make use of try-with-resources
	
ideas for algorithm:
	- pick randomly 10th grader and put him into first wish course.
	- if course is full, put him into second wish course
	- if course is full, put him into third wish course
	- if course is full, put him into pool wishesNotFullfilled
	
	- after tenth grader are distributed pick randomly a ninth or eighth grader and do the same like above.
